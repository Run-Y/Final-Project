ANALYSIS_ICE = [
    "Glacier melting reduces surface reflectivity, causing the Arctic to absorb more solar energy, accelerating global warming and affecting climate stability.",
    "Glacier melting changes ocean salinity, impacting marine ecosystems and species that depend on salinity balance.",
    "Initially, excessive glacier meltwater causes flooding; later, the disappearance of glaciers leads to long-term freshwater shortages.",
    "Glacier melting may cause glacial lake outburst floods, landslides, and floods, threatening residents in mountainous regions.",
    "Glacier retreat reduces freshwater supply, affecting crop yields in regions relying on glacier-fed irrigation.",
    "Melting glaciers decrease river flow, impacting hydropower generation in glacier-fed regions."

ANALYSIS_SEA = [
    "The global sea level has risen by about 20 cm over the past century, with the rate accelerating in the last 30 years, damaging coastal ecosystems and reducing biodiversity.",
    "Coastal areas face frequent floods and storm surges, causing property damage and casualties. For example, if sea levels continue rising at the current rate, cities like New York and Shanghai may face severe flooding in the coming decades.",
    "Residents in low-lying areas are forced to migrate, creating environmental refugees and increasing social pressure.",
