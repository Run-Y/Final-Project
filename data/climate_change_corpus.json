    ["What is climate change?", "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth, driven by human activities like deforestation and burning fossil fuels."],
    ["How is climate change affecting the Earth?", "Climate change is causing melting glaciers, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and threatening wildlife habitats."],
    ["What are greenhouse gases?", "Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming."],
    ["What can individuals do to help?", "Individuals can reduce energy consumption, use public transport, recycle, and advocate for environmental policies to mitigate climate change."],
    ["Is climate change reversible?", "While some effects are irreversible, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy can slow down or even stabilize future impacts."],
    ["What is global warming?", "Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate due to human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which increases greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."],
    ["How does deforestation contribute to climate change?", "Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2, contributing to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and accelerating climate change."],
    ["What is the Paris Agreement?", "The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels."],
    ["Why is the Arctic melting?", "The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average due to the greenhouse effect and feedback loops like ice-albedo, where melting ice exposes darker ocean water that absorbs more heat."],
    ["What role does agriculture play in climate change?", "Agriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock, deforestation for farming, and the use of fertilizers that release nitrous oxide."],
    ["Can renewable energy solve climate change?", "Renewable energy sources like solar and wind can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but full adoption will require changes in infrastructure, technology, and policy."],
    ["What are the impacts of climate change on health?", "Climate change can lead to heat stress, more frequent diseases like malaria, and worsen air quality, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases."]
